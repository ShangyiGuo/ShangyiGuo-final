![•	Synthesized n-channel nanowires (InP) with high electron mobility and p-channel nanowires (GaSb) with high hole mobility by controllable vapor-solid-solid growth mode of CVD. •	Studied in electrical and photoelectric properties of III-V nanowires (GaSb, InP) by using Semiconductor Device Analyzer and probe station. •	Read masses of papers with regard to the III-V nanowires and participated weekly group meetings. •	Working on the project now with Postdoc and PhD students.]( "Controllable synthesis and performance test of high-mobility III-V nanowires")
