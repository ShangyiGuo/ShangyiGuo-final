* I am an undergraduate student at School of Physics, Shandong University. I am keening on Condensed Matter Physics. My research  focuses on 2D quantum materials and devices and 1D semiconductors and optoelectronic devices now, including understanding electronic and quantum properties of 2D systems by nano-device fabrication and electronic transport measurements and controllable synthesis and performance investigation of III-V nanowires semiconductor nanostructures for optoelectronic device applications.
* Also, I want to learn some theoretical modeling methods such as first principles calculations to have a better understanding of novel quantum phenomena in condensed matters.
